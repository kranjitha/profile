				<p> I got to work with data from a new and different field to me i.e Semiconnductor industry. The experience has been exciting and full of challenges. One of the biggest challenges was to extract data from mdl files ( binary/ hex / text) files to extract levelling information. After a photo resist is applied to wafers, uniformity of that deposit has to be ensured. I got to work with the following during my tenure as an intern at Global Foundries: </p>
				<ul>
				<li> - Extraction of silicon wafer information from mdl files and storing them in parquet files (highly space efficent columnar storage)</li>
				<li> - Created a flask application that generates silicon wafer maps from data extracted and is used by technicians in FAB to inspect hotspots/ defects in silicon wafers after the photoresist is applied</li>
				<li> - Used those wafer images to predict if a wafer is good or bad</li>

			 <p>Known to be India's Largest bank, State Bank of India is called a banker to Every Indian. This opportunity was my door to the world of Data Science and shaped my intersts in the direction. I was tasked to find out what were the reasons why women are unable to access financial services provided by government of India as good as the men in the country. As an intern: </p> 
			 <ul>
			 <li> - Scraped and gathered data for various genders in various fields from the Government's census website.</li>
			 <li> - Ran correlation analysis to understand what factors were responsible and what measures can be taken to improve the current situation</li>
			 <li> - Presented our idea in a confernce held at IIM Ahmedabad and was appreciated by the jury.
			 <li> - Used python - pandas, numpy, selenium </li>

					Google Page Rank Algorithm is one of the most innovative solutions to rank web pages in a search engine. Initially, web pages were ranked based
					on the frequency of the key words in the search text but a spam web page can just have a single word repeated thousand to million times and be
					wrongfully claimed as a popular web page over a legit site which actually has useful related information. 
					Google page rank algorithm is a graph based algorithm that treats all the webpages as nodes of a graph and the importance of a webpage is determined by what webpages point to it. 
					Therefore the legitimacy of the popularity of webpage is given properly. Read more about google page rank algorithm <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> here </a>
					Here is how I used page rank algorithm to rank tennis players:
					
					</p>
					<ul style = "display :inline">
					
						<li> - Tennis Players cannot be ranked just based on the winning percentage because a lot of factors have to be taken into consideration. Some of the factors include: the age of match,
							the comparability of skills of both the tennis players, the format of match and various other factors
						</li>
						<li>
							- Used Networkx to arrange players in nodes. Originally page rank algorithm gives weight as 1 to each edge. The algorithm has been tweaked a little bit to give weighted edges 
							to give different importance to different matches based on the above mentioned factors. 
						</li>
							- Another change is to have multiple edges between the nodes to represent all the matches between players (eventually all the weights of edges are combined to give one single edge.).
						<li>
						</li>
					</ul>
